# Slot Booking System Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the improvements made to the slot booking system to meet the specified requirements for both users and owners.

## Requirements Implemented

### 1. User Side Improvements

#### ✅ Show Booked Slots in Red Color
- **Implementation**: Updated `SlotBookingModal.tsx` to display booked slots with red background (`bg-red-100 border-red-300 text-red-600`)
- **Visual Indicator**: Booked slots are clearly marked with red styling and "Booked" label
- **Tooltip Support**: Hover shows reason for unavailability (booked, maintenance, etc.)

#### ✅ Disable Selection of Booked Slots
- **Implementation**: Added `disabled={isBooked}` and `cursor-not-allowed` styling
- **Interaction**: Users cannot click or select slots that are already booked
- **Status Check**: Enhanced `getSlotStatus()` function to determine availability

#### ✅ Real-time Slot Updates
- **Socket.IO Integration**: Added real-time updates when slots are booked
- **Auto-refresh**: Slot availability refreshes automatically when other users book slots
- **Event Handling**: Listens for `slot_updated` events to refresh booking data

#### ✅ Display User's Own Bookings
- **Status Tracking**: Shows different states for user's own bookings vs others
- **Booking History**: Integration with existing booking system to show user's slots

### 2. Owner Side Improvements

#### ✅ Display Booked Slots with Player Details
- **New Endpoint**: Created `/api/bookings/owner/slots/:court_id` for detailed slot information
- **Player Information**: Shows player name, phone number, email, and booking status
- **Enhanced UI**: Updated `OwnerSlotManagement.tsx` to display player details in booked slots

#### ✅ Maintenance Slot Management
- **Maintenance Blocks**: Implemented maintenance_blocks table for owner-controlled unavailability
- **Visual Distinction**: Orange styling for maintenance slots vs red for booked slots
- **Reason Tracking**: Stores and displays maintenance reasons

#### ✅ Improved Slot Availability Function
- **Enhanced Backend**: Updated `getSlotsByCourtAndDate()` to include all slot states
- **Status Tracking**: Tracks `is_available`, `is_booked`, `is_blocked` states
- **Player Details**: Includes user information for booked slots (owner view only)

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Enhanced Booking Model (`bookingModel.js`)
```javascript
// Updated getSlotsByCourtAndDate() function
- Generates slots dynamically from court operating hours
- Joins with bookings and maintenance_blocks tables
- Returns comprehensive slot information including player details
- Separates public vs owner data access
```

#### 2. New Controller Functions (`bookingController.js`)
```javascript
// Added getOwnerSlotsController()
- Owner-specific endpoint with player details
- Proper authorization checks
- Enhanced slot information for management

// Updated getSlotsController()
- Public endpoint with limited information
- Hides sensitive player data
- Maintains backward compatibility
```

#### 3. Real-time Updates
```javascript
// Socket.IO events
- Emits 'slot_updated' when bookings are created
- Broadcasts to all connected clients
- Enables real-time slot availability updates
```

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Enhanced SlotBookingModal (`SlotBookingModal.tsx`)
```typescript
// Improved slot status handling
- getSlotStatus() function for comprehensive status checking
- Enhanced visual feedback with proper color coding
- Real-time updates via Socket.IO integration
- Better error handling and user feedback
```

#### 2. Owner Slot Management (`OwnerSlotManagement.tsx`)
```typescript
// Enhanced owner interface
- Uses owner-specific API endpoint
- Displays player details for booked slots
- Shows maintenance information
- Improved statistics and visual indicators
```

#### 3. Updated SlotGrid Component (`SlotGrid.tsx`)
```typescript
// Better slot visualization
- Color-coded status indicators
- Proper handling of different slot states
- Enhanced summary statistics
- Improved accessibility
```

## Database Schema Updates

### Maintenance Blocks Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS maintenance_blocks (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  court_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES courts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  block_date DATE NOT NULL,
  start_time TIME NOT NULL,
  end_time TIME NOT NULL,
  reason VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT 'Maintenance',
  created_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(court_id, block_date, start_time)
);
```

## API Endpoints

### New Endpoints
- `GET /api/bookings/owner/slots/:court_id` - Owner-specific slot details with player information
- `POST /api/bookings/slots/availability` - Update slot availability (maintenance blocks)

### Enhanced Endpoints
- `GET /api/bookings/slots/:court_id` - Public slot information (no player details)
