## ðŸ”’ Technical Implementation

### Slot Locking & Double-Booking Prevention
```javascript
// Database-level locking with transactions
await client.query('BEGIN');
const availabilityRes = await client.query(
  `SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM bookings 
   WHERE court_id = $1 AND booking_date = $2
   AND status IN ('booked', 'confirmed', 'completed')
   AND (start_time < $4 AND end_time > $3)
   FOR UPDATE`, // Row-level locking
  [court_id, booking_date, start_time, end_time]
);
```

### Real-Time Updates
```javascript
// Socket.IO integration for instant updates
socket.on('slot_updated', (data) => {
  if (data.courtId === parseInt(courtId) && data.date === date) {
    fetchSlots(); // Refresh slot data
  }
});
```

### One Slot at a Time Rule
```javascript
// Backend validation
const existingBookingRes = await client.query(
  `SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM bookings
   WHERE user_id = $1 AND booking_date = $2
   AND status IN ('booked', 'confirmed', 'completed')`,
  [user_id, booking_date]
);

if (parseInt(existingBookingRes.rows[0].count) > 0) {
  return res.status(409).json({ 
    error: 'You can only book one slot per day.',
    code: 'ONE_SLOT_LIMIT'
  });
}
```

## ðŸ“Š Database Schema

### Enhanced Booking Storage
```sql
-- All booking details stored with proper indexing
CREATE TABLE bookings (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  court_id INTEGER REFERENCES courts(id),
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  booking_date DATE NOT NULL,
  start_time TIME NOT NULL,
  end_time TIME NOT NULL,
  total_hours DECIMAL(4,2),
  total_amount DECIMAL(10,2),
  status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'booked',
  notes TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Maintenance blocks for owner control
CREATE TABLE maintenance_blocks (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  court_id INTEGER REFERENCES courts(id),
  block_date DATE NOT NULL,
  start_time TIME NOT NULL,
  end_time TIME NOT NULL,
  reason VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT 'Maintenance',
  created_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(court_id, block_date, start_time)
);
```
